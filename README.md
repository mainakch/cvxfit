# CvxFit

CvxFit is a package which provides classes for fitting convex functions to given data.

## Usage

Typical usage looks like this:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python

from cvxfit import CvxFit
import scipy as sp

# Generate data.
N = 1000
n = 3

def f_actual(x):
    return sp.sum(x*x)

X = sp.randn(N, n)
Y = sp.array([f_actual(pt) for pt in X])

# Initialize object with 10 affine functions
# with regularization 0.001, and maximum
# number of iterations 20.
fit_object = CvxFit(X=X, Y=Y, type='pwl', extra_param=[10, 0.001, 20])

# Perform fit.
fit_object.fit()

# See training error; repeat fit if high.
print 'Training error: ' + str(fit_object.mean_training_error)

# Compare quality of fit at a random point.
pt = sp.randn(1, n)
print 'Actual value: ' + str(f_actual(pt))
print 'Approximate value: ' + str(fit_object.evaluate(pt)[0])
```
